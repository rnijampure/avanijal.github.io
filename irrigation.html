        <h1>Irrigation Automation - Grow more Crop with less Water, Labour and Electricity... </h1>
        <p class="lead">Water is the lifeline of all species. Whole world, specially developing world is already in water crisis. We do not have luxury to waste water. How best we use the available water for irrigation and produce the best crop yield is the challenge we have today to feed 7+ billion (1.2+ billion in India alone).
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent years, ​the drip irrigation is being adopted in India and elsewhere in the world for efficient irrigation. Drip irrigation is better than the older flood and recent sprinkler irrigation. Even with drip irrigation, lot of water is wasted due to improper management and practically the crops either over irrigated or under irrigated. The yield drops in both cases and water and electricity wasted due to over irrigation. Drip irrigation also requires continuous monitoring and management of irrigation (motor on/off and open/close of irrigation valves). One person is required at the farm/site to manage the irrigation. Practically it is impossible to attend to the irrigation needs in time and results in over/under irrigation. ​Type your paragraph here.Type your paragraph here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to mass urbanization, getting an agriculture labour is big challenge. Even if farmer manages to get the labour, many a times they do not manage irrigation well due to ignorance and/or negligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            In India and in most of developing countries, the electricity is erratic and not available 24x7. In most states in India, the electricity is available only for 4-8 hours for agriculture. In summer, even this much electricity is unavailable. The availability can be at any time in 24 hours of the day. Due to odd time availability (say, 2.00 AM) the farmer has to go to farm to turn motor and on/off the irrigation valve. The human intervention is required throughout the irrigation cycle and irrigating in late evenings and nights is practically not possible/very difficult. Practically, most farmers do not visit and do not irrigate specially when the farms are far and hard to reach in night/odd hours.
        </p>
        <p>
            Few farmers have auto-starters, they keep one/two valve open till they visit the farm next day morning. In such case, only the area controlled by one/two valve (about 1-2 acre) gets irrigated for 6 hours! This causes over irrigation. The adjacent land which needs irrigation does not get irrigated. Over irrigation not only wastes water, electricity but also leaches out the fertilizer away from the root zone of the crop. This leached fertilizer mixes with ground water and pollutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Few farmer use SMS based motor on/off, at best he/she can irrigate the area controlled by one/two valve and the rest of the area do not get irrigated till some one visit the farm next day morning and turn on/off the rest of the values and that too if electricity exists, mostly not and there is no way the other land gets irrigated until next day !!
        </p>
        <p>
            Within 4-8 hours of availability, the electricity goes on/off multiple times which is very frustrating experience for farmer. It is difficult to keep track of time if he/she is irrigating based on length of irrigation time. This also leads to over/under irrigation. ​
        </p>
        <p>
            When the irrigation pump is on, the farmer needs to monitor water availability and switch off the motor (especially true in summer time) to avoid pump dry run</p>
